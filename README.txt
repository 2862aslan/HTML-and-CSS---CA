HTML & CSS CA Report
Reflection
When I read the lessons on Moodle, I thought I could do this assignment easily. But when I started working on it, I saw that it was not easy at all. I looked back at my notes again and again. I watched different YouTube videos about the problems I faced. Every time I solved a problem, I realized it brought me closer to my goal, and this made me happy. I felt the joy of learning.
If I had the chance to start over, I would create a more organized plan and proceed step by step. Allocating specific times for each phase would help me manage my time better and track my progress more consistently. Additionally, I would prefer to conduct a more extensive literature review to explore the topic in greater depth.
Although the assignment seemed challenging at first, it became easier as I proceeded with steady work. However, approaching the topic from a new perspective and creating original content was a time-consuming process. Through this assignment, I understood the importance of working in a planned way.
